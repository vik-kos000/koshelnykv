            <h3>A little history about me:</h3>
            <p id="Bio">
                I was born in Ukraine, but moved to United states when I was 2 years old.
                I graduated highschool in 2021 and started working as a full time
                nanny while taking a break from school. I love kids and really enjoyed it, 
                but after 2 years I decieded it was time to go back to school so now I've been 
                back in school for a little over a year and have been enjoying it a lot.
            </p>

            <h3>My experience with coding:</h3>
            <p id="Experience">
                So far I have learned phython, C#, SQL, Html, CSS, and Javascript. I still 
                have a lot to learn when it comes to software development which I am
                excited for. 
            </p>
